## Prerequisites
- An OKE **Enhanced cluster** (virtual nodes are not supported in Basic clusters).
- Administrative access to the tenancy or specific IAM policies for non-administrator users.
- A Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) with private subnets for virtual nodes and pods.
- Access to the OCI Console, OCI CLI, or API for cluster and node pool creation.
- Familiarity with Kubernetes pod specifications for resource allocation.
- The current date and time: **04:46 AM PKT, Friday, September 26, 2025**.

## Required IAM Policies

### 1. Mandatory Policy for All Users
- **Purpose**: Enables the OKE service to create container instances with VNICs connected to a subnet in the tenancy‚Äôs VCN for virtual nodes.
- **Scope**: Must be created in the **root compartment** of the tenancy.
- **Policy Statement**:
  ```plaintext
  Allow service OKE to manage container-instances in tenancy
  Allow service OKE to manage vnics in tenancy
  ```
- **Instructions**:
  - Copy the policy statements from the [OCI official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com) under ‚ÄúContainer Engine for Kubernetes‚Äù > ‚ÄúWorking with Virtual Nodes.‚Äù
  - In the OCI Console:
    - Go to **Identity & Security** > **Policies** > Select the root compartment.
    - Click **Create Policy**.
    - Name: e.g., `OKE-Virtual-Nodes-Service-Policy`.
    - Paste the statements and create the policy.
- **Applicability**: Required for both tenancy administrators and non-administrator users.

### 2. Policies for Non-Administrator Users
- **Purpose**: Grants non-administrator users permissions to manage virtual node pools, read network resources, and manage VNICs.
- **Policy Statements**:
  ```plaintext
  Allow group <GroupName> to manage cluster-virtual-node-pools in compartment <CompartmentName>
  Allow group <GroupName> to read virtual-network-family in compartment <CompartmentName>
  Allow group <GroupName> to manage vnics in compartment <CompartmentName>
  ```
  - Replace `<GroupName>` with the user group (e.g., `ClusterUsers`).
  - Replace `<CompartmentName>` with the target compartment (e.g., `CTDOKE`).
- **Instructions**:
  - Copy from the OCI documentation under ‚ÄúWorking with Virtual Nodes.‚Äù
  - Create the policy in the target compartment:
    - Go to **Identity & Security** > **Policies** > Select the compartment (e.g., `CTDOKE`).
    - Click **Create Policy**.
    - Name: e.g., `Virtual-Nodes-User-Policy`.
    - Paste the statements and create the policy.
- **Note**: Administrators with full tenancy access do not need these additional policies, as their privileges cover these actions.

## Creating and Configuring Virtual Nodes and Virtual Node Pools

### 1. Creating Virtual Node Pools
- **Requirement**: Virtual nodes are only supported in **Enhanced clusters**.
- **Methods**:
  - **OCI Console**:
    - Navigate to **Developer Services** > **Kubernetes Cluster (OKE)** > Select or create an Enhanced cluster.
    - Go to **Node Pools** > **Create Node Pool**.
    - Select **Virtual Nodes** as the node type.
  - **OCI CLI**:
    ```bash
    oci ce node-pool create --compartment-id <compartment-ocid> --cluster-id <cluster-ocid> --name <node-pool-name> --node-type VIRTUAL_NODE --size <node-count>
    ```
  - **API**: Use the `CreateNodePool` API with `nodeType` set to `VIRTUAL_NODE`.
- **Key Parameters**:
  - **Node Count**: Specify the number of virtual nodes (e.g., 3).
  - **Placement**: Choose availability domains (ADs) for high availability or use a regional subnet (recommended).
  - **Pod Shape**: Select a compute shape (e.g., `Pod.Standard.E3.Flex`) supported by OKE and available in your tenancy.
    - Only shapes compatible with OKE and your tenancy are displayed.
    - Align the shape with your application‚Äôs CPU and memory requirements.

### 2. Configuring Virtual Node Pools
- **Node Count**:
  - Defines the number of virtual nodes in the pool.
  - Example: Set to 3 for distribution across multiple availability domains.
- **Placement**:
  - **Regional Subnet**: Recommended for optimal performance and availability.
  - **Availability Domains**: Distribute nodes across ADs for high availability (e.g., one node per AD in a region with three ADs).
- **Pod Shape**:
  - Determines the processor type for pods running on virtual nodes.
  - Example: `Pod.Standard.E3.Flex` for flexible CPU/memory allocation.
  - Ensure the shape supports your application‚Äôs workload requirements.
- **Resource Allocation**:
  - Specify CPU and memory in the **pod specification** (not at the node pool level).
  - Example Pod Spec:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: example-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: example-container
        image: nginx
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: "1Gi"
          limits:
            cpu: "2"
            memory: "2Gi"
    ```
  - **Note**: Precision in defining requests and limits ensures optimal resource utilization.

### 3. Network Setup for Virtual Nodes
- **Pod Communication**:
  - **CNI Plugin**: Only **VCN-Native Pod Networking** is supported.
  - **Pod Subnet**:
    - Must be a **private regional subnet** (e.g., `10.0.2.0/24`).
    - Oracle recommends using the same subnet for pods and virtual nodes.
    - Configure route table rules for:
      - **NAT Gateway**: For outbound internet access.
      - **Service Gateway**: For access to OCI services (e.g., Object Storage).
  - **Security Rules**:
    - Use **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** instead of security lists for finer-grained control.
    - Maximum of 5 NSGs per subnet.
    - Example NSG Rule:
      - **Ingress**: Allow traffic from specific sources to pod ports.
      - **Egress**: Allow pods to communicate with external services.
    - Example:
      ```plaintext
      Ingress Rule: Source CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16, Protocol: TCP, Destination Port: 80
      Egress Rule: Destination CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0, Protocol: All
      ```

- **Virtual Node Communication**:
  - **Virtual Node Subnet**:
    - Must be a **private subnet** (regional recommended, e.g., `10.0.2.0/24`).
    - Must be distinct from load balancer subnets (if used).
    - Oracle recommends using the same subnet as the pod subnet.
  - **VNIC Allocation**:
    - Each virtual node uses a single VNIC.
    - IP addresses are dynamically allocated when pods are created, not pre-allocated.
  - **Route Table Rules**:
    - Ensure rules for NAT Gateway and Service Gateway are defined.

### 4. Additional Notes
- **Load Balancing**:
  - Traffic is distributed to pod IP addresses (`pod-ip:nodeport`) rather than node IPs.
  - Manual configuration of security rules is required for load balancers.
- **Scaling**:
  - Virtual node pools automatically scale up to **500 pods per virtual node**.
  - Increase the number of virtual nodes or node pools for additional capacity.
- **SSH Access**:
  - Virtual nodes do not support SSH access, as they are fully managed by OCI.
- **Official Documentation**:
  - Refer to [OCI official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com) under ‚ÄúContainer Engine for Kubernetes‚Äù > ‚ÄúWorking with Virtual Nodes‚Äù for policy statements and detailed setup instructions.

## Security Best Practices
- **IAM Policies**: Use least-privilege principles, restricting non-administrator users to specific compartments and resources.
- **Private Subnets**: Ensure pod and virtual node subnets are private to minimize exposure.
- **NSGs**: Prefer NSGs over security lists for granular access control.
- **CIDR Restrictions**: Limit NSG rules to specific source/destination CIDRs for pod and node communication.
- **Monitoring**: Regularly audit IAM policies and NSG rules in the OCI Console.

## Key Notes
- **Enhanced Clusters Only**: Virtual nodes require Enhanced clusters due to their serverless architecture.
- **Pod-Level Resources**: Specifying CPU/memory in pod specs allows precise resource allocation.
- **Networking Simplicity**: Using the same private subnet for pods and virtual nodes reduces complexity.
- **Automatic Management**: OCI handles upgrades, patching, and scaling for virtual nodes, reducing operational overhead.

## Next Steps
- **Practical Demo**: Create a virtual node pool and deploy a sample application using the OCI Console or CLI.
- **Advanced Networking**: Explore NSG configurations and load balancer setups for virtual nodes.
- **Performance Optimization**: Learn to fine-tune pod specifications for optimal resource usage.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the IAM policies and setup process for virtual nodes in OKE, ensuring secure and efficient cluster operations. By following these steps, you can deploy a resilient, high-performing Kubernetes environment tailored to your application needs.
