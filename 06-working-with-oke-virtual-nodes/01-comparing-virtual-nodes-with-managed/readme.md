## Overview
When creating a node pool in OKE, you can choose between **managed nodes** and **virtual nodes**. Each type offers distinct features, affecting how you manage, scale, and pay for your Kubernetes cluster. Below is a detailed comparison of their characteristics.

## Key Differences

### 1. Management Approach
- **Managed Nodes**:
  - **User Responsibility**: Users manage the nodes, including configuration, Kubernetes upgrades, and security patching.
  - **Flexibility**: Allows customization of nodes to meet specific requirements.
  - **Cluster Types**: Supported in both **Basic** and **Enhanced** clusters.
- **Virtual Nodes**:
  - **Serverless Experience**: OCI manages the nodes, handling Kubernetes upgrades and security patches while respecting application availability.
  - **Cluster Types**: Supported only in **Enhanced** clusters.
  - **Benefit**: Reduces operational overhead, as OCI automates node management.

### 2. Resource Allocation
- **Managed Nodes**:
  - **Node Pool Level**: CPU and memory requirements are specified at the node pool level during creation.
  - **Configuration**: Users define resources (e.g., shape, CPU, memory) for the entire node pool.
- **Virtual Nodes**:
  - **Pod Level**: CPU and memory requirements are specified in the pod specification using **requests** and **limits**.
  - **Benefit**: Offers fine-grained resource control, optimizing usage for individual pods.

### 3. Load Balancing
- **Managed Nodes**:
  - **Load Balancing**: Traffic is distributed among worker nodes (e.g., `node-ip:nodeport`).
  - **Security Lists**: Users may need to manually configure security list rules for load balancers, depending on the setup.
- **Virtual Nodes**:
  - **Load Balancing**: Traffic is distributed directly to pod IP addresses (e.g., `pod-ip:nodeport`).
  - **Security Lists**: Load balancer security list management is not enabled; users must manually configure security rules.
  - **Configuration**: Load balancers assign a node port and route traffic to pod IPs, requiring specific network setup.

### 4. Pod Networking
- **Managed Nodes**:
  - **CNI Plugins**: Supports both **VCN-Native Pod Networking** and **Flannel CNI** plugins.
  - **Flexibility**: Users can choose the networking model based on their needs.
- **Virtual Nodes**:
  - **CNI Plugin**: Only supports **VCN-Native Pod Networking**.
  - **VNIC Usage**: Each virtual node has a single VNIC; IP addresses are not pre-allocated before pod creation.
  - **CNI Visibility**: The VCN-Native Pod Networking CNI plugin does not appear as running in the `kube-system` namespace.
  - **Network Requirements**: Pod subnet route tables must include rules for a **NAT Gateway** and **Service Gateway** to ensure connectivity.

### 5. Scaling
- **Managed Nodes**:
  - **User Responsibility**: Users manually adjust cluster capacity by changing the number of node pools or nodes.
  - **Autoscaling**: Optional **node pool autoscaling** can be enabled to automatically scale nodes and pods based on demand.
  - **Control**: Provides flexibility but requires active management.
- **Virtual Nodes**:
  - **Automated Scaling**: OCI manages cluster capacity, automatically scaling virtual node pools.
  - **Capacity**: Each virtual node supports up to **500 pods**; users can increase the number of virtual nodes or node pools to scale up.
  - **Benefit**: Eliminates operational overhead for capacity management.

### 6. Pricing
- **Managed Nodes**:
  - **Cost Model**: Charged based on the compute instances (e.g., `VM.Standard.E3.Flex`) allocated to the node pool, regardless of actual pod usage.
  - **Predictability**: Fixed cost based on instance size and count.
- **Virtual Nodes**:
  - **Cost Model**: Charged based on the exact compute resources (CPU and memory) consumed by each pod.
  - **Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go model, potentially reducing costs for variable workloads.

### 7. Additional Considerations
- **SSH Access**:
  - **Managed Nodes**: Support SSH access for administrative tasks (e.g., log collection, maintenance) if a public SSH key is provided during node pool creation.
  - **Virtual Nodes**: Do not support SSH access, as they are fully managed by OCI.
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Managed Nodes**: Ideal for workloads requiring fine-tuned control, custom configurations, or SSH access for troubleshooting.
  - **Virtual Nodes**: Suited for serverless, scalable applications where operational simplicity and automatic management are priorities.
