## What is Kubernetes?

When deploying and managing microservices in a distributed environment, you may encounter issues such as:
- Container failures or crashes
- Scheduling containers to specific machines based on configuration
- Upgrading or rolling back containerized applications
- Scaling containers up or down across multiple machines

## Containers and Their Challenges

Meet Jamal, who loves working with containers. A **container** is a standard unit of software that packages an application and its dependencies, ensuring it runs reliably across different environments. Think of containers as lightweight virtual machines.

Jamal designs his applications using containers, and they work well. He hands them over to Tricia from operations to deploy on production servers. As the application grows in popularity, Tricia needs to scale resources to handle the increasing workload. Managing hundreds of containers becomes overwhelming, and Tricia needs a way to automate the process.

## Enter Kubernetes

Mo introduces Tricia to **Kubernetes**, a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. It facilitates declarative configuration and automation.

### Analogy: Kubernetes as an Orchestra Conductor

Think of Kubernetes as a conductor for an orchestra. Just as a conductor decides how many violins are needed, which play first, and how loud they should play, Kubernetes determines:
- How many containers (e.g., webserver front-end or back-end database) are needed
- What they serve
- How many resources are allocated to each

## How Kubernetes Works

In Kubernetes, there is a **master node** and multiple **worker nodes**. Each worker node can handle multiple **pods**, which are groups of containers clustered together as a working unit.

Tricia designs her application using pods and defines the desired state for the master node, specifying how many pods of each microservice are needed (e.g., three containers for microservice A, two for microservices B and C).

From there, Kubernetes takes control:
- It deploys pods to worker nodes based on availability and load.
- If a worker node fails, Kubernetes automatically starts new pods on functioning nodes.

## Benefits of Kubernetes

With Kubernetes, Tricia no longer worries about the complexity of managing containers. She can focus on observability and application security. Kubernetes provides:
- **Scalability**: Run containerized applications at any scale without downtime.
- **Self-healing**: Automatically recover from container failures.
- **Autoscaling**: Adjust container numbers based on workload for optimal resource use.
- **Simplified deployment**: Perform complex operations reliably with just a few commands.
