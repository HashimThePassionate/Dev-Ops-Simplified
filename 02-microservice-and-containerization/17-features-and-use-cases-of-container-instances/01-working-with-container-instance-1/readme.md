## Introduction

OCI Container Instances provide a serverless, secure, and flexible way to run containerized applications without managing infrastructure. This guide is designed for users like Alex, who need to run isolated web applications or RESTful APIs with minimal operational overhead. We will discuss IAM policies for access control, compute shapes for resource allocation, and ephemeral storage for managing container resources.

## Key Concepts and Features

### 1. IAM Policies for Container Instances
IAM policies in OCI govern access to container instances and define permissions for users or groups to create, modify, or delete container instances within a tenancy. Policies are essential for controlling access to resources and ensuring secure operations.

#### Resource Types
- **Individual Resource Types**:
  - `compute-container-instances`: Refers to container instance resources.
  - `compute-containers`: Refers to individual containers within a container instance.
- **Aggregate Resource Type**: `compute-container-family` includes both `compute-container-instances` and `compute-containers`.

#### Permission Levels
- **Inspect**: Allows listing resources (e.g., `compute_container_instance_inspect` for container instances, `compute_container_inspect` for containers).
- **Read**: Includes inspect and read permissions.
- **Use**: Includes inspect, read, update, start, stop, and restart permissions.
- **Manage**: Grants all permissions for the resource type.

#### Policy Syntax Examples
1. **Full Access to Container Instances in a Compartment**:
   To allow a user group to manage container instances and related resources in compartment `ABC`:
   ```
   Allow group <GroupName> to manage compute-container-family in compartment ABC
   Allow group <GroupName> to use virtual-network-family in compartment ABC
   Allow group <GroupName> to read repos in tenancy
   ```
   - Enables managing container instances, networking, and pulling images from OCI Container Registry (OCIR).

2. **Network Security Group (NSG) Access**:
   To control traffic to/from container instances using NSGs:
   ```
   Allow group ContainerInstanceLaunchers to use network-security-groups in compartment ABC
   ```

3. **Pulling Images from Private OCIR Repositories**:
   - **Step 1**: Create a dynamic group for container instances:
     ```
     ALL {resource.type = 'computecontainerinstance'}
     ```
     Name the dynamic group (e.g., `ContainerInstanceDynamicGroup`).
   - **Step 2**: Allow the dynamic group to read OCIR repositories:
     ```
     Allow dynamic-group ContainerInstanceDynamicGroup to read repos in tenancy
     ```
     This enables seamless image retrieval from private OCIR repositories.

4. **Access to OCI Vault Secrets**:
   To allow container instances to access Vault Secrets (e.g., for image authorization):
   - **Step 1**: Create a dynamic group:
     ```
     ALL {resource.type = 'computecontainerinstance'}
     ```
     Name the dynamic group (e.g., `ContainerInstanceDynamicGroup`).
   - **Step 2**: Grant read access to Vault Secrets:
     ```
     Allow dynamic-group ContainerInstanceDynamicGroup to read secret-bundles in tenancy
     ```
   - **Note**: Store credentials as secrets in OCI Vault. Use standard IAM mechanisms to restrict access to specific secrets or compartments for finer control.

#### Best Practices
- Use least privilege principles to limit permissions to specific compartments or resources.
- Regularly review and update IAM policies to align with security requirements.

### 2. Container Instance Shapes
OCI Container Instances support various compute shapes to suit different workload demands:
- **Available Shapes**:
  - `CI.Standard.E3.Flex`
  - `CI.Standard.E4.Flex`
  - `CI.Standard.A1.Flex`
- **Flexible Shapes**: Allow customization of OCPUs (Oracle Compute Units) and memory allocation during initialization, enabling fine-tuned performance and cost optimization.
- **Features**:
  - **Network Bandwidth**: Scales with OCPUs, from 1 Gbps per OCPU to a maximum of 40 Gbps.
  - **Storage**: Includes 15 GB of ephemeral storage per instance.
  - **Virtual Network Interface Card (VNIC)**: One VNIC for seamless integration into your Virtual Cloud Network (VCN).

### 3. Extended OCPUs
- **Purpose**: Designed for high-performance workloads requiring more cores than standard configurations.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Exceed standard core limits (e.g., up to 64 cores or ~128 vCPUs and 1,024 GB of memory with E3/E4 Flex shapes).
  - Tailor resource allocation for demanding applications.
- **Consideration**: Instances with extended OCPUs may take longer to create due to increased resource allocation.

### 4. Ephemeral Storage
Ephemeral storage is shared storage allocated to a container instance and its containers. It is critical for:
- Storing container images.
- Supporting container root overlay file systems.
- Managing logs and temporary data.

#### Key Components Consuming Ephemeral Storage
1. **Container Images**:
   - Used to download, unpack, and prepare images for deployment.
   - **Storage Requirement**: Free space required can be up to **twice the size** of the container image.
     - Example: With 15 GB default ephemeral storage, images should be <7.5 GB to ensure successful deployment. Insufficient space may cause instance creation to fail.
2. **Container Logs**:
   - Each container retains up to 20 MB of log files.
3. **Root Overlay File System**:
   - Used for file backups to ensure data integrity.
4. **emptyDir Volumes**:
   - Provides temporary storage for container data.
5. **Internal System Processes**:
   - Consume a small portion of ephemeral storage for essential system operations.

#### Monitoring Ephemeral Storage
- Access metrics on ephemeral storage usage via the OCI Console in the **Container Instance Details** page.
- Regularly monitor to manage resources effectively and avoid deployment failures.

## Use Case for Alex
For Alex, who wants to test isolated web applications or RESTful APIs without managing servers:
- **IAM Policies**: Configure policies to allow his user group to manage container instances in a specific compartment and pull images from OCIR private repositories using a dynamic group and Vault Secrets.
- **Shapes**: Use flexible shapes (e.g., `CI.Standard.E4.Flex`) to allocate appropriate CPU and memory for his applicationâ€™s needs.
- **Extended OCPUs**: Leverage for resource-intensive APIs if needed.
- **Ephemeral Storage**: Ensure container images are sized appropriately (<7.5 GB) and monitor logs to avoid storage issues.

## Summary
This guide covered:
- **IAM Policies**: Configuring permissions for `compute-container-instances` and `compute-containers` to control access, including policies for OCIR image pulls and Vault Secrets.
- **Shapes**: Flexible shapes (`E3`, `E4`, `A1`) for tailoring CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.
- **Extended OCPUs**: Support for high-performance workloads with increased core counts.
- **Ephemeral Storage**: Critical for images, logs, file systems, and temporary storage, with monitoring via the OCI Console.

These features enable users like Alex to run containerized applications efficiently, securely, and without infrastructure management overhead.
